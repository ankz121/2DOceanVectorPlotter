# 2DOceanVectorPlotter
Plotting a 2D vector which displays ocean current directions using matplotlib.pyplot. Currents are plotted at a certain depth only. Dataset was downloaded from the ROMS Real Time Forecasting website. The file were formatted in a .nc file type.
To change the depth simply change the array index on depth = depths[]
Change m, n to use more or less data.


Sample nc file was uploaded.
See results for results.
